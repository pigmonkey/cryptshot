# Open and mount a LUKS volume before performing a backup.
#
# This script first checks to see if a volume with the given UUID exists.  If
# the volume is found, it is treated as a LUKS volume and decrypted with the
# given key file, after which it is mounted. The script then runs the specified
# backup program. After the backup is complete, the volume is unmounted and the
# LUKS mapping is removed. Optionally, the mount point can be deleted to
# complete the clean-up.
#
# Since the first step taken is to check if the given volume exists, it is
# appropriate for situations where the external backup volume is not always
# available to the machine (such as a USB backup drive and a laptop).
#
# If using rsnapshot, the interval should be passed with the -i argument.
